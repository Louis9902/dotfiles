# Louis's dotfiles ~/

- This repository contains **my** dotfiles
- You're quite welcome to make suggestions, however I may decline if it's not of
  personal value to me.

## Setup

For installing these dotfiles I recommend using a dotfile manager like stow. If
one does not have the opportunity to install a package, one may use the
`dot-link.py` script for installing.
